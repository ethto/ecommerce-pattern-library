The buttons use secondary and highlight colours to stand our from the rest of the site. Each button has it's own purpose:

- The standard button is for things such as "read me" or "see more"
- The bold buttons are used for more serious things such as "I accept" or "Confirm Purchase"
- The bold ghost button is used everywhere else, similar use as the standard but with the option of adding higher visibility and balance within the site.
