The buttons use secondary and highlight colours to stand our from the rest of the site. Each button has it's own purpose:

- The standard button is for things such as "read me" or "see more"
- The bold buttons are used for more serious things such as "Confirm" or "Cancel" purchase.
- The bold ghost button is used everywhere else, similar use as the standard but with the option of adding higher visibility and balance within the site.
- The nav and footer buttons are always white used on the charcoal background, which is why we can't see them in the pattern library. These are the main nav links, and the footer links such as terms of use and FAQ.
